        lore: `The magical spear of Alvina, sister to Corsair, of the Frozen Blade, one of the Three Blade Masters. She was able to overcome the dark power sleeping in her blood, and thus managed to awaken the draconic power in this spear. They say that Alvina herself, with her incomparable spear technique and the way she wove magical dragons and blades of ice, appeared like a goddess on the battlefield. They say her power possessed a will of its own, and at times it left its mistress' hands to attack and return, unbidden.`

        lore: `This magical scepter was wielded by Berwick, one of the Juno Templars. They say that it was made of a sacred flame that had burned since ancient times, and the blaze sleeping within is powerful enough to consume all it touches. The flames change with the magical power its user feeds them, and he can thus control not only their power but their form. The scepter also responds to the user's character, and since the flames created by his aggressive nature were a danger even to his allies, no one dared to come close to him in battle.`
