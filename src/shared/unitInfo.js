When he sensed the Ancient War would grow only longer and more cruel, his frenzied attack served to restrain the Sea Dragons, and protect his people from further battle. History hides his true intent, though he regrets nothing."

However, he still was not able to find the \"Destruction Giant.\" One day, Yummi fell under the trap of a woman of the Spirit race and attacked him.

The swordsman had a smile throughout the battle, and when the girl's frenzy abated, he held out his hand and took her on his journey."

She was able to do so because of the golden hairs from a fox spirit what were mixed into the head of the brush.

The sudden flash of light that emanated from the canvas forced her to shut her eyes. When she opened them, however, the illustration... No, the Fox Deity that had jumped out of the illustration stood before her. This led her to deciding to embark on a journey the next morning, saying farewell to the shrine that had been so good to her. It was through this journey that countless picture scrolls were produced, and would eventually be passed down throughout the generations. One of these scrolls was the 'Legend of the Sealed Fox.'"

The very prescence of the Templars, devotees who supporter her in every aspect of life, was proof of that."

Her days are spent in knight training along with her best friend Valerie. She surpassed the order's standards for swordplay when she was only eleven years old. The aspiration to become a great warrior like her grandfather carries her through the toughest drills with an upbeat attitude.",
                evoawk: "Although sturdy enough in mind and body to undergo knight training, she threw a tantrum when Zeorg said he was joining the Demon Suppression Corps. So great was her dissent that she clung to his legs on the day he departed. This expression of both the fear he would not return and the anger she was not strong enough to replace the elderly soldier was, if nothing else, age-appropriate."

Although her lack of self sufficiency does hurt a bit, the 3 aps she gets from her TW helps.

Because it is conditional to the enemy being a giant boss (which includes over 70% of bosses, including all raids and mines bosses), it stacks with other dmg res buffs.`,
